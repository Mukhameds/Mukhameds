System Architect | Founder of ARA  
Building adaptive AI systems beyond neural networks

I am a system architect and founder working on alternative AI architectures.

My work focuses on signal-based adaptive systems that learn, predict,
and evolve through internal structure — without neural networks,
datasets, or retraining loops.

Currently building ARA and STB-DEMO — a working prototype that
demonstrates error-driven adaptation, prediction, and long-lived intelligence.


## Current Focus

- Signal-based AI architectures (STB — Signal Theory of Being)
- Adaptive systems and prediction without inference pipelines
- Error-driven learning and structural self-modification
- Long-lived autonomous AI systems


## Projects

- **STB-DEMO**  
  A working prototype demonstrating signal-based learning, prediction,
  structural adaptation, competition of hypotheses, and forgetting —
  without datasets or retraining.

- **ARA**  
  A long-lived personal AI architecture built on STB principles,
  designed as a continuous adaptive system rather than a static model.


## Research

I explore how intelligence can emerge from reactive signal structures,
inspired by neurobiology, physics, and distributed systems.

The goal is to build AI as a controllable, economically viable system,
not as a static model or API-based service.
