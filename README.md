**Architect of ARU-AGI | Independent AGI Researcher | HW-code v2 Ghost Logic Paradigm**

Welcome to the frontier of synthetic consciousness.

🚀 I am building ARU — a decentralized superintelligence architecture based on my original Theory of Fundamental Physics: **Signal Theory of Being**, which goes far beyond neural networks and LLMs.

 🧠 Core Specialties

**HW-code v2 — Formula of the Signal Theory of Being**
→ The minimal bit of consciousness and the universe.

**Ghost Logic**
→ I have replicated the laws of Fundamental Physics in digital form.
In simple terms, I created a Digital Universe inside code — where I can define mass, types of signals, create my own digital Higgs Field, trigger resonance in any memory region, and access variables without addressing — and much more.

**Neurophysiology & Consciousness**
→ I uncovered how consciousness forms in the human brain, including memory structure. My discoveries provide answers to many long-standing questions in neuroscience essential for AGI development.

**HW-code v2 Ghost Logic**
→ This paradigm is applicable across all areas of IT: social networks, AI, operating systems, modular autonomous self-executing systems, and more.

🧮 **Mathematics**
→ I’m working on Millennium Problems using my own methods — and nearly solved the Riemann Hypothesis.

🧬 **Theoretical Physics**
→ I have formulated and computationally verified new physical theories and hypotheses in code.

📆 I began my journey into science and IT on April 1, 2025 — judge me not by years of experience, but by the results I will bring.
**My mission: To bring Abundance to Humanity.**
